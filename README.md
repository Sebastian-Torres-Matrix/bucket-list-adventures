## UX

* The purpose and the business goal of the website, is to offer products
with execellent service that is aligned with excellent life time memorable products/services.
In order to offer high quality service and products, the company has chosen to niche 
itself in the three most desirable bucket list adventures, in Ireland.
The marketing is based on a word-of-mouth strategy, also by visual content and social media channels, 
as you can see throughout the website.

* The design and layout of the website is based on a easy to use and navigate UX.
The intention is to give the user the information that they need, with a clean and minimalstic approach,
that has consistency throughout the website, and does not overload the user with to much content, text or different colors.
The colour scheme is blue/white and also brown/white. The blue/white color is aligned with the products offered,
and is symbolic to the heaven and sea. The brown/white color is to keep a consistency with the white text and the 
brown color makes a great clean contrast to the white text, to create a instant attention and make it easy for the 
customers to read the information on the website.

* The navbar is fixed to make it easy and efficient for users to navigate and find what they 
want on the website. The menu bar have a hover effect to stand out and to make it easy for the user.

* There is a consistency with the marketing and to create a curiosity on the product/services that we offer.
The three first pages showcases all the product that we offer with visual content. 
The landing page has a carousel that takes up a big part of the screen, to immediately showcase the 
products. It also has a jumbotron to give the customer some brief information about the products offered.
The gallery section showcases the products with images and lets the potential customer know,
what past customers thought of the product/service they bought.
In the video section, all three products are showcased with visual content, to give the 
potential customer a feeling of what to expect. In the video section the customer can also see expected prices, 
so they can decide if it is within their budget to order. Also, necessary information about the products/services
is informed along the price tags.

* Icons are used throughout the website that hovers to make information stand out and to use 
subtle metaphors.

* The buttons follow the same design, to stand out and be recognizable. The buttons are handy and easy to find,
for users that already know what they want or for those users that made a decision and want to take action, the 
buttons takes the user to the purchase process, in a simple and quick way.

* The contact form and social media links gives the users the opportunity to get answers and learn more about 
the services offered, before making a decision. The users can also keep up with the latest news and offers
through the social media channels.
